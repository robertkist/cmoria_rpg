# CMoria RPG
A RPG game with retro graphics for Playdate console, PC, Mac, Linux and retro computers (Amiga, MacOS 7.6 m68k, MS-DOS 386/486 PC).

## WIP

This game is a work-in-progress. This repo will contain my efforts to port and combine various prototypes from Java and Python to ANSI C, which compiles on the various platforms I'd like to target.

## Why CMoria?

Moria is one of the first rogue-likes with a town level. My aim is to write a game with mechanics similar to Ultima IV/V. Like Moria it has a top-down view, town levels, and I might even add some procedural generation. The C stands for C (the language I'm using) ... or it could stand for cats, which will feature prominently in the story and the lore.

## Where's the source code?

I just started this repo... It will be added soon(tm)

## Planned features

- Ultima IV/V style fog-of-war
- Ultima V style NPC dialogs and vendors
- A battle map
- Inventories, stats and talents
- Ultima VI style dungeons
- All kinds of melee and ranged weapons
- A magic and abilities system

## Why target Retro-Computers?

Because I can :) The game isn't going to be computationally expensive. If it runs on the playdate, it might just as well run on some early 32-bit platforms. Also, being a collector of some vintage PCs, I thought it would be great to see my own game running on the vintage hardware I own.
