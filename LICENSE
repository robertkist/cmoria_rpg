SUMMARY:
This summary is intended to give a quick overview of the license. It does not
supersede the license terms above, and in conflict, the above stated license
terms prevail.

TLDR;
- The code and its related tools for building executable software is governed
  by the Modified MIT license stated above. It can be freely used, both
  commercially and non commercially following the above restrictions.
  This means you can take parts of the code, or the entire code, and use it
  however you want. But you will have to make your own artwork, story, audio,
  narrative and setting if you want to use it for your own game or similar
  endeavours.
- Any artwork is not covered by the MIT license but, instead, by US and
  international copyright law and the conditions set out above. You can copy
  and distribute artwork freely with the source code and with compiled versions
  of the software, as long as it is for non-commercial purposes, credit is
  given, and the artwork has not been modified. Any exceptions require written
  permission from the author.
  This means you cannot sell this game as long as any of the original artwork
  is included. However, you can freely distribute it - give a copy to your
  friends, share it on a forum, etc. You can distribute compiled versions
  independently of the source code - it doesn't have to be included.
  You are not allowed to modifiy the included artwork and then distribute
  the game, either for free or for profit.
